### Section 10: Combinatorics

| Type | Without Repetition | With Repetition |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Permutation: Arrange | $P_n = n!$ |  |
| Variation: Arrange + Pick | $V_{n,p} = \frac{n!}{(n-p)!}$ | $V_{n,p}^{\bar{}} = n^p$ |
| Combination: Pick (order doesn't matter) | $C_{n,p} = \frac{n!}{p!(n-p)!}$ | $C_{n,p}^{\bar{}} = \frac{(n+p-1)!}{p!(n-1)!}$ |

> Note: $n$ = number of objects, $p$ = number of objects to pick
> $C = \frac{V}{P!}$ if there is no repetition
