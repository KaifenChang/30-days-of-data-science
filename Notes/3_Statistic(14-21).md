### Section 15: Descriptive Statistics
#### Fundamentals
| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Sample vs Population | Sample is a randomized and representative subset of the population |
| Level of Measurement |**Qualitative(categorical)**<br> - Nominal: Categories with no order (e.g. colors) <br> - Ordinal: Categories with order (e.g. rankings) <br> **Quantitative (numerical)** <br> - Interval: Numeric with arbitrary zero (e.g. temperature) <br> - Ratio: Numeric with absolute zero (e.g. height) |
| Visualization | - Frequency distribution table <br> - Bar chart <br> - Pie chart <br> - Pareto diagram <br> - Histogram <br> - Box plot <br> - Scatter plot <br> - Line chart  |
| Relative Frequency | Frequency of a value divided by the total number of values in the dataset |
| Cumulative Frequency | Sum of all frequencies up to and including a given value |

#### Mean, Median, Mode
| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Mean (μ) | Average of all values in the dataset |
| Median | Middle value of the dataset when arranged in ascending order |
| Mode | Value that appears most frequently in the dataset |

#### Skewness
 Measure of the asymmetry of a distribution
| Concept | Relationship |Description |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Positive Skewness | mean > median| Right-tailed distribution (long tail on the right) |
| Negative Skewness | mean < median | Left-tailed distribution (long tail on the left) |
| Zero Skewness | mean = median = mode | Symmetric distribution |

#### Varibility
| Concept | Description | Note |
|---------|-------------|------|
| Variance (σ², s²) | Square of standard deviation <br> σ² for population, s² for sample |
| Standard Deviation (σ, s) | Measure of the spread of values in the dataset <br> σ for population, s for sample |single dataset
| Coefficient of Variation (CV) | Standard deviation divided by mean (σ/μ or s/x̄) <br> Allows comparison between datasets with different units | 2 or more datasets with different units |

#### Relationship
| Concept | Description | Note |
|---------|-------------|------|
| Covariance | Measure of how **two variables vary in tandem** from their means <br> Positive: Variables move together <br> Negative: Variables move in opposite directions <br> Zero: No linear relationship | cannot compare accross datasets |
| Correlation | Measure of the strength and direction of a **linear relationship** between two variables <br> -1 to 1 <br> -1: Perfect negative correlation <br> 0: No correlation <br> 1: Perfect positive correlation | can compare accross datasets |
| Covariance vs Correlation | Covariance measures the joint variability of two variables, while correlation measures the strength and direction of their linear relationship |
