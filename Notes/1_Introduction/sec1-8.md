## Section 1-4
In these sections, we are mainly discussing the difference between terms and roles such as BI, DS, DA, ML, etc.

It is a good idea for learner to distinguish these roles by the time of data analysis.


|Time|Analysis Stage|About|Corresponding Role|
|-------- | ---------------|------------------ | -------------------------------- |
|**Past**|Descriptive |What happened? |BI (Business Intelligence)|
|**Now**|Diagnostic|Why it happened? |BA (Business Analytics)|
|**Near Future**|Exploratory + Predictive|What will happen? |DA (Data Analytics)|
|**Mid Future**|Predictive + Prescriptive|What should be done? |DS (Data Science)|
|**Far Future**|Automated Prediction + Decision|How to do it? |ML (Machine Learning)|
