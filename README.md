# Data Science Self-Study Challenge

Welcome to my personal **30-Day Data Science Challenge**, a self-directed journey to build strong foundations in data science, one day at a time.

I'm a math major with a passion for problem-solving and analytics. With this challenge, I aim to **transition from theory to real-world application**, and seeking a **more concise direction** as a math student. also building consistent habits and tracking my progress in public.

## Why I'm Doing This

After years of feeling stuck and doubting myself, I realized I can’t keep waiting for the "right moment." This challenge is my way of reclaiming direction and building momentum, not just in my career, but in life.

If you're also navigating uncertainty, or trying to rebuild from scratch, I hope my journey gives you a little hope, structure, or motivation.

Let's get better one day at a time.
